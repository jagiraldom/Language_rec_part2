0," Nature, in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical, material world or universe.",English
1,"""Nature"" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general.",English
2,"The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science.",English
3,"Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.",English
4,"[1] The word nature is borrowed from the Old French nature and is derived from the Latin word natura, or ""essential qualities, innate disposition"", and in ancient times, literally meant ""birth"".",English
5,"[2] In ancient philosophy, natura is mostly used as the Latin translation of the Greek word physis (φύσις), which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics that plants, animals, and other features of the world develop of their own accord.",English
6,"[3][4] 
The concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is one of several expansions of the original notion;[1] it began with certain core applications of the word φύσις by pre-Socratic philosophers (though this word had a dynamic dimension then, especially for Heraclitus), and has steadily gained currency ever since.",English
7,"During the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries, nature became the passive reality, organized and moved by divine laws.",English
8,"[5][6] With the Industrial revolution, nature increasingly became seen as the part of reality deprived from intentional intervention : it was hence considered as sacred by some traditions (Rousseau, American transcendentalism) or a mere decorum for divine providence or human history (Hegel, Marx).",English
9,"However, a vitalist vision of nature, closer to the presocratic one, got reborn at the same time, especially after Charles Darwin.",English
10,"[1] Within the various uses of the word today, ""nature"" often refers to geology and wildlife.",English
11,"Nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objects—the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the Earth.",English
12,"It is often taken to mean the ""natural environment"" or wilderness—wild animals, rocks, forest, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, or which persist despite human intervention.",English
13,"For example, manufactured objects and human interaction generally are not considered part of nature, unless qualified as, for example, ""human nature"" or ""the whole of nature"".",English
14,"This more traditional concept of natural things that can still be found today implies a distinction between the natural and the artificial, with the artificial being understood as that which has been brought into being by a human consciousness or a human mind.",English
15,"Depending on the particular context, the term ""natural"" might also be distinguished from the unnatural or the supernatural.",English
16,"[1] Earth is the only planet known to support life, and its natural features are the subject of many fields of scientific research.",English
17,"Within the solar system, it is third closest to the sun; it is the largest terrestrial planet and the fifth largest overall.",English
18,"Its most prominent climatic features are its two large polar regions, two relatively narrow temperate zones, and a wide equatorial tropical to subtropical region.",English
19,"[7] Precipitation varies widely with location, from several metres of water per year to less than a millimetre.",English
20,71 percent of the Earth's surface is covered by salt-water oceans.,English
21,"The remainder consists of continents and islands, with most of the inhabited land in the Northern Hemisphere.",English
22,Earth has evolved through geological and biological processes that have left traces of the original conditions.,English
23,The outer surface is divided into several gradually migrating tectonic plates.,English
24,"The interior remains active, with a thick layer of plastic mantle and an iron-filled core that generates a magnetic field.",English
25,"This iron core is composed of a solid inner phase, and a fluid outer phase.",English
26,"Convective motion in the core generates electric currents through dynamo action, and these, in turn, generate the geomagnetic field.",English
27,"The atmospheric conditions have been significantly altered from the original conditions by the presence of life-forms,[8] which create an ecological balance that stabilizes the surface conditions.",English
28,"Despite the wide regional variations in climate by latitude and other geographic factors, the long-term average global climate is quite stable during interglacial periods,[9] and variations of a degree or two of average global temperature have historically had major effects on the ecological balance, and on the actual geography of the Earth.",English
29,[10][11] Geology is the science and study of the solid and liquid matter that constitutes the earth.,English
30,"The field of geology encompasses the study of the composition, structure, physical properties, dynamics, and history of Earth materials, and the processes by which they are formed, moved, and changed.",English
31,"The field is a major academic discipline, and is also important for mineral and hydrocarbon extraction, knowledge about and mitigation of natural hazards, some Geotechnical engineering fields, and understanding past climates and environments.",English
32,The geology of an area evolves through time as rock units are deposited and inserted and deformational processes change their shapes and locations.,English
33,Rock units are first emplaced either by deposition onto the surface or intrude into the overlying rock.,English
34,"Deposition can occur when sediments settle onto the surface of the Earth and later lithify into sedimentary rock, or when as volcanic material such as volcanic ash or lava flows, blanket the surface.",English
35,"Igneous intrusions such as batholiths, laccoliths, dikes, and sills, push upwards into the overlying rock, and crystallize as they intrude.",English
36,"After the initial sequence of rocks has been deposited, the rock units can be deformed and/or metamorphosed.",English
37,"Deformation typically occurs as a result of horizontal shortening, horizontal extension, or side-to-side (strike-slip) motion.",English
38,"These structural regimes broadly relate to convergent boundaries, divergent boundaries, and transform boundaries, respectively, between tectonic plates.",English
39,"Earth is estimated to have formed 4.54 billion years ago from the solar nebula, along with the Sun and other planets.",English
40,[12] The moon formed roughly 20 million years later.,English
41,"Initially molten, the outer layer of the Earth cooled, resulting in the solid crust.",English
42,Outgassing and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere.,English
43,"Condensing water vapor, most or all of which came from ice delivered by comets, produced the oceans and other water sources.",English
44,[13] The highly energetic chemistry is believed to have produced a self-replicating molecule around 4 billion years ago.,English
45,"[14] Continents formed, then broke up and reformed as the surface of Earth reshaped over hundreds of millions of years, occasionally combining to make a supercontinent.",English
46,"Roughly 750 million years ago, the earliest known supercontinent Rodinia, began to break apart.",English
47,"The continents later recombined to form Pannotia which broke apart about 540 million years ago, then finally Pangaea, which broke apart about 180 million years ago.",English
48,"[16] During the Neoproterozoic era, freezing temperatures covered much of the Earth in glaciers and ice sheets.",English
49,"This hypothesis has been termed the ""Snowball Earth"", and it is of particular interest as it precedes the Cambrian explosion in which multicellular life forms began to proliferate about 530–540 million years ago.",English
50,[17] Since the Cambrian explosion there have been five distinctly identifiable mass extinctions.,English
51,"[18] The last mass extinction occurred some 66 million years ago, when a meteorite collision probably triggered the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs and other large reptiles, but spared small animals such as mammals.",English
52,"Over the past 66 million years, mammalian life diversified.",English
53,"[19] Several million years ago, a species of small African ape gained the ability to stand upright.",English
54,"[15] The subsequent advent of human life, and the development of agriculture and further civilization allowed humans to affect the Earth more rapidly than any previous life form, affecting both the nature and quantity of other organisms as well as global climate.",English
55,"By comparison, the Great Oxygenation Event, produced by the proliferation of algae during the Siderian period, required about 300 million years to culminate.",English
56,"The present era is classified as part of a mass extinction event, the Holocene extinction event, the fastest ever to have occurred.",English
57,"[20][21] Some, such as E. O. Wilson of Harvard University, predict that human destruction of the biosphere could cause the extinction of one-half of all species in the next 100 years.",English
58,"[22] The extent of the current extinction event is still being researched, debated and calculated by biologists.",English
59,[23][24][25] The Earth's atmosphere is a key factor in sustaining the ecosystem.,English
60,The thin layer of gases that envelops the Earth is held in place by gravity.,English
61,"Air is mostly nitrogen, oxygen, water vapor, with much smaller amounts of carbon dioxide, argon, etc.",English
62,The atmospheric pressure declines steadily with altitude.,English
63,The ozone layer plays an important role in depleting the amount of ultraviolet (UV) radiation that reaches the surface.,English
64,"As DNA is readily damaged by UV light, this serves to protect life at the surface.",English
65,"The atmosphere also retains heat during the night, thereby reducing the daily temperature extremes.",English
66,"Terrestrial weather occurs almost exclusively in the lower part of the atmosphere, and serves as a convective system for redistributing heat.",English
67,"[26] Ocean currents are another important factor in determining climate, particularly the major underwater thermohaline circulation which distributes heat energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions.",English
68,These currents help to moderate the differences in temperature between winter and summer in the temperate zones.,English
69,"Also, without the redistributions of heat energy by the ocean currents and atmosphere, the tropics would be much hotter, and the polar regions much colder.",English
70,Weather can have both beneficial and harmful effects.,English
71,"Extremes in weather, such as tornadoes or hurricanes and cyclones, can expend large amounts of energy along their paths, and produce devastation.",English
72,"Surface vegetation has evolved a dependence on the seasonal variation of the weather, and sudden changes lasting only a few years can have a dramatic effect, both on the vegetation and on the animals which depend on its growth for their food.",English
73,Climate is a measure of the long-term trends in the weather.,English
74,"Various factors are known to influence the climate, including ocean currents, surface albedo, greenhouse gases, variations in the solar luminosity, and changes to the Earth's orbit.",English
75,"Based on historical records, the Earth is known to have undergone drastic climate changes in the past, including ice ages.",English
76,"The climate of a region depends on a number of factors, especially latitude.",English
77,A latitudinal band of the surface with similar climatic attributes forms a climate region.,English
78,"There are a number of such regions, ranging from the tropical climate at the equator to the polar climate in the northern and southern extremes.",English
79,"Weather is also influenced by the seasons, which result from the Earth's axis being tilted relative to its orbital plane.",English
80,"Thus, at any given time during the summer or winter, one part of the Earth is more directly exposed to the rays of the sun.",English
81,This exposure alternates as the Earth revolves in its orbit.,English
82,"At any given time, regardless of season, the northern and southern hemispheres experience opposite seasons.",English
83,"Weather is a chaotic system that is readily modified by small changes to the environment, so accurate weather forecasting is limited to only a few days.",English
84,"[27] Overall, two things are happening worldwide: (1) temperature is increasing on the average; and (2) regional climates have been undergoing noticeable changes.",English
85,[28] Water is a chemical substance that is composed of hydrogen and oxygen (H2O) and is vital for all known forms of life.,English
86,"[29] In typical usage, water refers only to its liquid form or state, but the substance also has a solid state, ice, and a gaseous state, water vapor, or steam.",English
87,Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface.,English
88,"[30] On Earth, it is found mostly in oceans and other large bodies of water, with 1.6% of water below ground in aquifers and 0.001% in the air as vapor, clouds, and precipitation.",English
89,"[31][32] Oceans hold 97% of surface water, glaciers, and polar ice caps 2.4%, and other land surface water such as rivers, lakes, and ponds 0.6%.",English
90,"Additionally, a minute amount of the Earth's water is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products.",English
91,"An ocean is a major body of saline water, and a principal component of the hydrosphere.",English
92,"Approximately 71% of the Earth's surface (an area of some 361 million square kilometers) is covered by ocean, a continuous body of water that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas.",English
93,"More than half of this area is over 3,000 meters (9,800 feet) deep.",English
94,"Average oceanic salinity is around 35 parts per thousand (ppt) (3.5%), and nearly all seawater has a salinity in the range of 30 to 38 ppt.",English
95,"Though generally recognized as several 'separate' oceans, these waters comprise one global, interconnected body of salt water often referred to as the World Ocean or global ocean.",English
96,[33][34] This concept of a global ocean as a continuous body of water with relatively free interchange among its parts is of fundamental importance to oceanography.,English
97,"[35] The major oceanic divisions are defined in part by the continents, various archipelagos, and other criteria: these divisions are (in descending order of size) the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, the Southern Ocean, and the Arctic Ocean.",English
98,"Smaller regions of the oceans are called seas, gulfs, bays and other names.",English
99,"There are also salt lakes, which are smaller bodies of landlocked saltwater that are not interconnected with the World Ocean.",English
100,Two notable examples of salt lakes are the Aral Sea and the Great Salt Lake.,English
101,"A lake (from Latin word lacus) is a terrain feature (or physical feature), a body of liquid on the surface of a world that is localized to the bottom of basin (another type of landform or terrain feature; that is, it is not global) and moves slowly if it moves at all.",English
102,"On Earth, a body of water is considered a lake when it is inland, not part of the ocean, is larger and deeper than a pond, and is fed by a river.",English
103,"[36][37] The only world other than Earth known to harbor lakes is Titan, Saturn's largest moon, which has lakes of ethane, most likely mixed with methane.",English
104,"It is not known if Titan's lakes are fed by rivers, though Titan's surface is carved by numerous river beds.",English
105,"Natural lakes on Earth are generally found in mountainous areas, rift zones, and areas with ongoing or recent glaciation.",English
106,Other lakes are found in endorheic basins or along the courses of mature rivers.,English
107,"In some parts of the world, there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last Ice Age.",English
108,"All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.",English
109,"A pond is a body of standing water, either natural or man-made, that is usually smaller than a lake.",English
110,"A wide variety of man-made bodies of water are classified as ponds, including water gardens designed for aesthetic ornamentation, fish ponds designed for commercial fish breeding, and solar ponds designed to store thermal energy.",English
111,Ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams via current speed.,English
112,"While currents in streams are easily observed, ponds and lakes possess thermally driven micro-currents and moderate wind driven currents.",English
113,"These features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features, such as stream pools and tide pools.",English
114,"A river is a natural watercourse,[38] usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, a lake, a sea or another river.",English
115,"In a few cases, a river simply flows into the ground or dries up completely before reaching another body of water.",English
116,"Small rivers may also be called by several other names, including stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill; there is no general rule that defines what can be called a river.",English
117,Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; one example is Burn in Scotland and North-east England.,English
118,"Sometimes a river is said to be larger than a creek, but this is not always the case, due to vagueness in the language.",English
119,[39] A river is part of the hydrological cycle.,English
120,"Water within a river is generally collected from precipitation through surface runoff, groundwater recharge, springs, and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks (i.e., from glaciers).",English
121,"A stream is a flowing body of water with a current, confined within a bed and stream banks.",English
122,"In the United States, a stream is classified as a watercourse less than 60 feet (18 metres) wide.",English
123,"Streams are important as conduits in the water cycle, instruments in groundwater recharge, and they serve as corridors for fish and wildlife migration.",English
124,The biological habitat in the immediate vicinity of a stream is called a riparian zone.,English
125,"Given the status of the ongoing Holocene extinction, streams play an important corridor role in connecting fragmented habitats and thus in conserving biodiversity.",English
126,"The study of streams and waterways in general involves many branches of inter-disciplinary natural science and engineering, including hydrology, fluvial geomorphology, aquatic ecology, fish biology, riparian ecology, and others.",English
127,Ecosystems are composed of a variety of biotic and abiotic components that function in an interrelated way.,English
128,[41] The structure and composition is determined by various environmental factors that are interrelated.,English
129,Variations of these factors will initiate dynamic modifications to the ecosystem.,English
130,"Some of the more important components are soil, atmosphere, radiation from the sun, water, and living organisms.",English
131,Central to the ecosystem concept is the idea that living organisms interact with every other element in their local environment.,English
132,"Eugene Odum, a founder of ecology, stated: ""Any unit that includes all of the organisms (ie: the ""community"") in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure, biotic diversity, and material cycles (i.e.",English
133,: exchange of materials between living and nonliving parts) within the system is an ecosystem.,English
134,"""[42] Within the ecosystem, species are connected and dependent upon one another in the food chain, and exchange energy and matter between themselves as well as with their environment.",English
135,"[43] The human ecosystem concept is based on the human/nature dichotomy and the idea that all species are ecologically dependent on each other, as well as with the abiotic constituents of their biotope.",English
136,[44] A smaller unit of size is called a microecosystem.,English
137,"For example, a microsystem can be a stone and all the life under it.",English
138,"A macroecosystem might involve a whole ecoregion, with its drainage basin.",English
139,[45] Wilderness is generally defined as areas that have not been significantly modified by human activity.,English
140,"Wilderness areas can be found in preserves, estates, farms, conservation preserves, ranches, national forests, national parks, and even in urban areas along rivers, gulches, or otherwise undeveloped areas.",English
141,"Wilderness areas and protected parks are considered important for the survival of certain species, ecological studies, conservation, and solitude.",English
142,"Some nature writers believe wilderness areas are vital for the human spirit and creativity,[46] and some ecologists consider wilderness areas to be an integral part of the Earth's self-sustaining natural ecosystem (the biosphere).",English
143,"They may also preserve historic genetic traits and that they provide habitat for wild flora and fauna that may be difficult or impossible to recreate in zoos, arboretums, or laboratories.",English
144,"Although there is no universal agreement on the definition of life, scientists generally accept that the biological manifestation of life is characterized by organization, metabolism, growth, adaptation, response to stimuli, and reproduction.",English
145,[47] Life may also be said to be simply the characteristic state of organisms.,English
146,"Properties common to terrestrial organisms (plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria) are that they are cellular, carbon-and-water-based with complex organization, having a metabolism, a capacity to grow, respond to stimuli, and reproduce.",English
147,An entity with these properties is generally considered life.,English
148,"However, not every definition of life considers all of these properties to be essential.",English
149,Human-made analogs of life may also be considered to be life.,English
150,"The biosphere is the part of Earth's outer shell—including land, surface rocks, water, air and the atmosphere—within which life occurs, and which biotic processes in turn alter or transform.",English
151,"From the broadest geophysiological point of view, the biosphere is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships, including their interaction with the elements of the lithosphere (rocks), hydrosphere (water), and atmosphere (air).",English
152,"The entire Earth contains over 75 billion tons (150 trillion pounds or about 6.8×1013 kilograms) of biomass (life), which lives within various environments within the biosphere.",English
153,"[48] Over nine-tenths of the total biomass on Earth is plant life, on which animal life depends very heavily for its existence.",English
154,"[49] More than 2 million species of plant and animal life have been identified to date,[50] and estimates of the actual number of existing species range from several million to well over 50 million.",English
155,"[51][52][53] The number of individual species of life is constantly in some degree of flux, with new species appearing and others ceasing to exist on a continual basis.",English
156,[54][55] The total number of species is in rapid decline.,English
157,"[56][57][58] The origin of life on Earth is not well understood, but it is known to have occurred at least 3.5 billion years ago,[61][62][63] during the hadean or archean eons on a primordial Earth that had a substantially different environment than is found at present.",English
158,[64] These life forms possessed the basic traits of self-replication and inheritable traits.,English
159,"Once life had appeared, the process of evolution by natural selection resulted in the development of ever-more diverse life forms.",English
160,Species that were unable to adapt to the changing environment and competition from other life forms became extinct.,English
161,"However, the fossil record retains evidence of many of these older species.",English
162,Current fossil and DNA evidence shows that all existing species can trace a continual ancestry back to the first primitive life forms.,English
163,[64] When basic forms of plant life developed the process of photosynthesis the sun's energy could be harvested to create conditions which allowed for more complex life forms.,English
164,[65] The resultant oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere and gave rise to the ozone layer.,English
165,The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the development of yet more complex cells called eukaryotes.,English
166,"[66] Cells within colonies became increasingly specialized, resulting in true multicellular organisms.",English
167,"With the ozone layer absorbing harmful ultraviolet radiation, life colonized the surface of Earth.",English
168,"The first form of life to develop on the Earth were microbes, and they remained the only form of life until about a billion years ago when multi-cellular organisms began to appear.",English
169,"[67] Microorganisms are single-celled organisms that are generally microscopic, and smaller than the human eye can see.",English
170,"They include Bacteria, Fungi, Archaea, and Protista.",English
171,"These life forms are found in almost every location on the Earth where there is liquid water, including in the Earth's interior.",English
172,"[68]
Their reproduction is both rapid and profuse.",English
173,"The combination of a high mutation rate and a horizontal gene transfer[69] ability makes them highly adaptable, and able to survive in new environments, including outer space.",English
174,[70] They form an essential part of the planetary ecosystem.,English
175,"However, some microorganisms are pathogenic and can post health risk to other organisms.",English
176,"Originally Aristotle divided all living things between plants, which generally do not move fast enough for humans to notice, and animals.",English
177,"In Linnaeus' system, these became the kingdoms Vegetabilia (later Plantae) and Animalia.",English
178,"Since then, it has become clear that the Plantae as originally defined included several unrelated groups, and the fungi and several groups of algae were removed to new kingdoms.",English
179,"However, these are still often considered plants in many contexts.",English
180,"Bacterial life is sometimes included in flora,[71][72] and some classifications use the term bacterial flora separately from plant flora.",English
181,"Among the many ways of classifying plants are by regional floras, which, depending on the purpose of study, can also include fossil flora, remnants of plant life from a previous era.",English
182,"People in many regions and countries take great pride in their individual arrays of characteristic flora, which can vary widely across the globe due to differences in climate and terrain.",English
183,"Regional floras commonly are divided into categories such as native flora and agricultural and garden flora, the lastly mentioned of which are intentionally grown and cultivated.",English
184,"Some types of ""native flora"" actually have been introduced centuries ago by people migrating from one region or continent to another, and become an integral part of the native, or natural flora of the place to which they were introduced.",English
185,This is an example of how human interaction with nature can blur the boundary of what is considered nature.,English
186,Another category of plant has historically been carved out for weeds.,English
187,"Though the term has fallen into disfavor among botanists as a formal way to categorize ""useless"" plants, the informal use of the word ""weeds"" to describe those plants that are deemed worthy of elimination is illustrative of the general tendency of people and societies to seek to alter or shape the course of nature.",English
188,"Similarly, animals are often categorized in ways such as domestic, farm animals, wild animals, pests, etc.",English
189,according to their relationship to human life.,English
190,Animals as a category have several characteristics that generally set them apart from other living things.,English
191,"Animals are eukaryotic and usually multicellular (although see Myxozoa), which separates them from bacteria, archaea, and most protists.",English
192,"They are heterotrophic, generally digesting food in an internal chamber, which separates them from plants and algae.",English
193,"They are also distinguished from plants, algae, and fungi by lacking cell walls.",English
194,With a few exceptions—most notably the two phyla consisting of sponges and placozoans—animals have bodies that are differentiated into tissues.,English
195,"These include muscles, which are able to contract and control locomotion, and a nervous system, which sends and processes signals.",English
196,There is also typically an internal digestive chamber.,English
197,The eukaryotic cells possessed by all animals are surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of collagen and elastic glycoproteins.,English
198,"This may be calcified to form structures like shells, bones, and spicules, a framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganized during development and maturation, and which supports the complex anatomy required for mobility.",English
199,"Although humans comprise only a minuscule proportion of the total living biomass on Earth, the human effect on nature is disproportionately large.",English
200,"Because of the extent of human influence, the boundaries between what humans regard as nature and ""made environments"" is not clear cut except at the extremes.",English
201,"Even at the extremes, the amount of natural environment that is free of discernible human influence is diminishing at an increasingly rapid pace.",English
202,The development of technology by the human race has allowed the greater exploitation of natural resources and has helped to alleviate some of the risk from natural hazards.,English
203,"In spite of this progress, however, the fate of human civilization remains closely linked to changes in the environment.",English
204,There exists a highly complex feedback loop between the use of advanced technology and changes to the environment that are only slowly becoming understood.,English
205,"[73] Man-made threats to the Earth's natural environment include pollution, deforestation, and disasters such as oil spills.",English
206,Humans have contributed to the extinction of many plants and animals.,English
207,Humans employ nature for both leisure and economic activities.,English
208,The acquisition of natural resources for industrial use remains a sizable component of the world's economic system.,English
209,"[74][75] Some activities, such as hunting and fishing, are used for both sustenance and leisure, often by different people.",English
210,Agriculture was first adopted around the 9th millennium BCE.,English
211,"Ranging from food production to energy, nature influences economic wealth.",English
212,"Although early humans gathered uncultivated plant materials for food and employed the medicinal properties of vegetation for healing,[76] most modern human use of plants is through agriculture.",English
213,"The clearance of large tracts of land for crop growth has led to a significant reduction in the amount available of forestation and wetlands, resulting in the loss of habitat for many plant and animal species as well as increased erosion.",English
214,"[77] Beauty in nature has historically been a prevalent theme in art and books, filling large sections of libraries and bookstores.",English
215,"That nature has been depicted and celebrated by so much art, photography, poetry, and other literature shows the strength with which many people associate nature and beauty.",English
216,"Reasons why this association exists, and what the association consists of, are studied by the branch of philosophy called aesthetics.",English
217,"Beyond certain basic characteristics that many philosophers agree about to explain what is seen as beautiful, the opinions are virtually endless.",English
218,[78] Nature and wildness have been important subjects in various eras of world history.,English
219,An early tradition of landscape art began in China during the Tang Dynasty (618–907).,English
220,The tradition of representing nature as it is became one of the aims of Chinese painting and was a significant influence in Asian art.,English
221,"Although natural wonders are celebrated in the Psalms and the Book of Job, wilderness portrayals in art became more prevalent in the 1800s, especially in the works of the Romantic movement.",English
222,British artists John Constable and J. M. W. Turner turned their attention to capturing the beauty of the natural world in their paintings.,English
223,"Before that, paintings had been primarily of religious scenes or of human beings.",English
224,"William Wordsworth's poetry described the wonder of the natural world, which had formerly been viewed as a threatening place.",English
225,Increasingly the valuing of nature became an aspect of Western culture.,English
226,[79] This artistic movement also coincided with the Transcendentalist movement in the Western world.,English
227,"A common classical idea of beautiful art involves the word mimesis, the imitation of nature.",English
228,Also in the realm of ideas about beauty in nature is that the perfect is implied through perfect mathematical forms and more generally by patterns in nature.,English
229,"As David Rothenburg writes, ""The beautiful is the root of science and the goal of art, the highest possibility that humanity can ever hope to see"".",English
230,"[80]:281 Some fields of science see nature as matter in motion, obeying certain laws of nature which science seeks to understand.",English
231,"For this reason the most fundamental science is generally understood to be ""physics""—the name for which is still recognizable as meaning that it is the ""study of nature"".",English
232,Matter is commonly defined as the substance of which physical objects are composed.,English
233,It constitutes the observable universe.,English
234,The visible components of the universe are now believed to compose only 4.9 percent of the total mass.,English
235,The remainder is believed to consist of 26.8 percent cold dark matter and 68.3 percent dark energy.,English
236,[81] The exact arrangement of these components is still unknown and is under intensive investigation by physicists.,English
237,The behaviour of matter and energy throughout the observable universe appears to follow well-defined physical laws.,English
238,These laws have been employed to produce cosmological models that successfully explain the structure and the evolution of the universe we can observe.,English
239,The mathematical expressions of the laws of physics employ a set of twenty physical constants[82] that appear to be static across the observable universe.,English
240,"[83] The values of these constants have been carefully measured, but the reason for their specific values remains a mystery.",English
241,"Outer space, also simply called space, refers to the relatively empty regions of the Universe outside the atmospheres of celestial bodies.",English
242,Outer space is used to distinguish it from airspace (and terrestrial locations).,English
243,"There is no discrete boundary between Earth's atmosphere and space, as the atmosphere gradually attenuates with increasing altitude.",English
244,"Outer space within the Solar System is called interplanetary space, which passes over into interstellar space at what is known as the heliopause.",English
245,"Outer space is sparsely filled with several dozen types of organic molecules discovered to date by microwave spectroscopy, blackbody radiation left over from the Big Bang and the origin of the universe, and cosmic rays, which include ionized atomic nuclei and various subatomic particles.",English
246,"There is also some gas, plasma and dust, and small meteors.",English

250,"[84] For a brief period in Mars' history, it may have also been capable of forming life.",English
251,"At present though, most of the water remaining on Mars is frozen.",English
252,"If life exists at all on Mars, it is most likely to be located underground where liquid water can still exist.",English
253,"[85] Conditions on the other terrestrial planets, Mercury and Venus, appear to be too harsh to support life as we know it.",English

256,[87] Media: Organizations: Philosophy:   Wikipedia (/ˌwɪkɪˈpiːdiə/ (listen) wik-ih-PEE-dee-ə or /ˌwɪki-/ (listen) wik-ee-) is a multilingual open-collaborative online encyclopedia created and maintained by a community of volunteer editors using a wiki-based editing system.,English
257,"It is one of the 15 most popular websites as ranked by Alexa, as of January 2021[update][3] and The Economist newspaper placed it as the ""13th-most-visited place on the web"".",English
258,"[4] Featuring no advertisements, it is hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation, an American non-profit organization funded primarily through donations.",English
259,"Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001, by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger.",English
260,"Sanger coined its name[5][6] as a portmanteau of ""wiki"" and ""encyclopedia"".",English
261,"It was initially an English-language encyclopedia, but versions in other languages were quickly developed.",English
262,"With 6.2 million articles, the English Wikipedia is the largest of the 317 Wikipedia encyclopedias.",English
263,"Overall, Wikipedia comprises more than 55 million articles,[7] attracting 1.7 billion unique visitors per month.",English
264,"[8][9] Wikipedia has been criticized for its uneven accuracy and for exhibiting systemic bias, including gender bias, with the majority of editors being male.",English
265,[4] Edit-a-thons have been held to encourage female editors and increase the coverage of women's topics.,English
266,"[10] In 2006, Time magazine stated that the open-door policy of allowing anyone to edit had made Wikipedia the biggest and possibly the best encyclopedia in the world, and was a testament to the vision of Jimmy Wales.",English
267,"[11] The project's reputation improved further in the 2010s as it increased efforts to improve its quality and reliability, based on its unique structure, curation and absence of commercial bias.",English
268,"[4] In 2018, Facebook and YouTube announced that they would help users detect fake news by suggesting links to related Wikipedia articles.",English
269,"[12] Other collaborative online encyclopedias were attempted before Wikipedia, but none were as successful.",English
270,"[13] Wikipedia began as a complementary project for Nupedia, a free online English-language encyclopedia project whose articles were written by experts and reviewed under a formal process.",English
271,"[14] It was founded on March 9, 2000, under the ownership of Bomis, a web portal company.",English
272,"Its main figures were Bomis CEO Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, editor-in-chief for Nupedia and later Wikipedia.",English
273,"[15][16] Nupedia was initially licensed under its own Nupedia Open Content License, but even before Wikipedia was founded, Nupedia switched to the GNU Free Documentation License at the urging of Richard Stallman.",English
274,"[17] Wales is credited with defining the goal of making a publicly editable encyclopedia,[18][19] while Sanger is credited with the strategy of using a wiki to reach that goal.",English
275,"[20] On January 10, 2001, Sanger proposed on the Nupedia mailing list to create a wiki as a ""feeder"" project for Nupedia.",English
276,"[21] The domains wikipedia.com and wikipedia.org were registered on January 12, 2001,[22] and January 13, 2001,[23] respectively, and Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001,[14] as a single English-language edition at www.wikipedia.com,[24] and announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list.",English
277,"[18] Wikipedia's policy of ""neutral point-of-view""[25] was codified in its first few months.",English
278,"Otherwise, there were relatively few rules initially and Wikipedia operated independently of Nupedia.",English
279,"[18] Originally, Bomis intended to make Wikipedia a business for profit.",English
280,"[26] Wikipedia gained early contributors from Nupedia, Slashdot postings, and web search engine indexing.",English
281,"Language editions were also created, with a total of 161 by the end of 2004.",English
282,"[27] Nupedia and Wikipedia coexisted until the former's servers were taken down permanently in 2003, and its text was incorporated into Wikipedia.",English
283,"The English Wikipedia passed the mark of two million articles on September 9, 2007, making it the largest encyclopedia ever assembled, surpassing the Yongle Encyclopedia made during the Ming Dynasty in 1408, which had held the record for almost 600 years.",English
284,"[28] Citing fears of commercial advertising and lack of control in Wikipedia, users of the Spanish Wikipedia forked from Wikipedia to create the Enciclopedia Libre in February 2002.",English
285,"[29] Wales then announced that Wikipedia would not display advertisements, and changed Wikipedia's domain from wikipedia.com to wikipedia.org.",English
286,"[30][31] Though the English Wikipedia reached three million articles in August 2009, the growth of the edition, in terms of the numbers of new articles and of contributors, appears to have peaked around early 2007.",English
287,"[32] Around 1,800 articles were added daily to the encyclopedia in 2006; by 2013 that average was roughly 800.",English
288,[33] A team at the Palo Alto Research Center attributed this slowing of growth to the project's increasing exclusivity and resistance to change.,English
289,"[34] Others suggest that the growth is flattening naturally because articles that could be called ""low-hanging fruit""—topics that clearly merit an article—have already been created and built up extensively.",English
290,"[35][36][37]  In November 2009, a researcher at the Rey Juan Carlos University in Madrid found that the English Wikipedia had lost 49,000 editors during the first three months of 2009; in comparison, the project lost only 4,900 editors during the same period in 2008.",English
291,[38][39] The Wall Street Journal cited the array of rules applied to editing and disputes related to such content among the reasons for this trend.,English
292,"[40] Wales disputed these claims in 2009, denying the decline and questioning the methodology of the study.",English
293,"[41] Two years later, in 2011, Wales acknowledged the presence of a slight decline, noting a decrease from ""a little more than 36,000 writers"" in June 2010 to 35,800 in June 2011.",English
294,"In the same interview, Wales also claimed the number of editors was ""stable and sustainable"".",English

316,"[55][56] In June 2019, scientists reported that all 16 GB of article text from the English Wikipedia have been encoded into synthetic DNA.",English
317,"[57] Unlike traditional encyclopedias, Wikipedia follows the procrastination principle[note 3] regarding the security of its content.",English
318,"[60] It started almost entirely open—anyone could create articles, and any Wikipedia article could be edited by any reader, even those who did not have a Wikipedia account.",English
319,Modifications to all articles would be published immediately.,English
320,"As a result, any article could contain inaccuracies such as errors, ideological biases, and nonsensical or irrelevant text.",English
321,"Due to the increasing popularity of Wikipedia, some editions, including the English version, have introduced editing restrictions for certain cases.",English
322,"For instance, on the English Wikipedia and some other language editions, only registered users may create a new article.",English
323,"[61] On the English Wikipedia, among others, particularly controversial, sensitive or vandalism-prone pages have been protected to varying degrees.",English
324,"[62][63] A frequently vandalized article can be semi-protected or extended confirmed protected, meaning that only autoconfirmed or extended confirmed editors are able to modify it.",English
325,[64] A particularly contentious article may be locked so that only administrators are able to make changes.,English
326,"[65] A 2021 article in the Columbia Journalism Review identified Wikipedia's page protection policies as ""[p]erhaps the most important"" means at Wikipedia's disposal to ""regulate its market of ideas"".",English
327,"[66] In certain cases, all editors are allowed to submit modifications, but review is required for some editors, depending on certain conditions.",English
328,"For example, the German Wikipedia maintains ""stable versions"" of articles,[67] which have passed certain reviews.",English
329,"Following protracted trials and community discussion, the English Wikipedia introduced the ""pending changes"" system in December 2012.",English
330,"[68] Under this system, new and unregistered users' edits to certain controversial or vandalism-prone articles are reviewed by established users before they are published.",English
331,"[69] Although changes are not systematically reviewed, the software that powers Wikipedia provides tools allowing anyone to review changes made by others.",English
332,"The ""History"" page of each article links to each revision.",English
333,"[note 4][70] On most articles, anyone can undo others' changes by clicking a link on the article's history page.",English

335,"""New pages patrol"" is a process whereby newly created articles are checked for obvious problems.",English
336,"[71] In 2003, economics Ph.D. student Andrea Ciffolilli argued that the low transaction costs of participating in a wiki create a catalyst for collaborative development, and that features such as allowing easy access to past versions of a page favor ""creative construction"" over ""creative destruction"".",English
337,[72] Any change or edit that manipulates content in a way that purposefully compromises the integrity of Wikipedia is considered vandalism.,English
338,The most common and obvious types of vandalism include additions of obscenities and crude humor.,English
339,Vandalism can also include advertising and other types of spam.,English
340,[73] Sometimes editors commit vandalism by removing content or entirely blanking a given page.,English
341,"Less common types of vandalism, such as the deliberate addition of plausible but false information to an article can be more difficult to detect.",English
342,"Vandals can introduce irrelevant formatting, modify page semantics such as the page's title or categorization, manipulate the underlying code of an article, or use images disruptively.",English
343,[74] Obvious vandalism is generally easy to remove from Wikipedia articles; the median time to detect and fix vandalism is a few minutes.,English
344,"[75][76] However, some vandalism takes much longer to repair.",English
345,"[77] In the Seigenthaler biography incident, an anonymous editor introduced false information into the biography of American political figure John Seigenthaler in May 2005.",English
346,Seigenthaler was falsely presented as a suspect in the assassination of John F.,English

350,"Wales replied that he did not, although the perpetrator was eventually traced.",English
351,"[78][79] After the incident, Seigenthaler described Wikipedia as ""a flawed and irresponsible research tool"".",English
352,"[77] This incident led to policy changes at Wikipedia, specifically targeted at tightening up the verifiability of biographical articles of living people.",English

354,"On a later episode, he commented on the edits to the article, most of them offensive, which had been made by the audience and had prompted the article to be locked from editing.",English
355,"[81][82] Wikipedians often have disputes regarding content, which may result in repeatedly making opposite changes to an article, known as ""edit warring"".",English
356,[83][84] The process is widely seen as a resource-consuming scenario where no useful knowledge is added.,English
357,"[85] This practice is also criticized as creating a competitive,[86] conflict based[87] editing culture associated with traditional masculine gender roles,[88] which contributes to the gender bias on Wikipedia.",English
358,Special interest groups have engaged in edit wars to advance their own political interests.,English
359,"Content in Wikipedia is subject to the laws (in particular, copyright laws) of the United States and of the US state of Virginia, where the majority of Wikipedia's servers are located.",English
360,"Beyond legal matters, the editorial principles of Wikipedia are embodied in the ""five pillars"" and in numerous policies and guidelines intended to appropriately shape content.",English
361,"Even these rules are stored in wiki form, and Wikipedia editors write and revise the website's policies and guidelines.",English
362,[89] Editors can enforce these rules by deleting or modifying non-compliant material.,English
363,"Originally, rules on the non-English editions of Wikipedia were based on a translation of the rules for the English Wikipedia.",English
364,They have since diverged to some extent.,English
365,"[67] According to the rules on the English Wikipedia, each entry in Wikipedia must be about a topic that is encyclopedic and is not a dictionary entry or dictionary-style.",English
366,"[90] A topic should also meet Wikipedia's standards of ""notability"",[91] which generally means that the topic must have been covered in mainstream media or major academic journal sources that are independent of the article's subject.",English
367,"Further, Wikipedia intends to convey only knowledge that is already established and recognized.",English
368,[92] It must not present original research.,English
369,A claim that is likely to be challenged requires a reference to a reliable source.,English
370,"Among Wikipedia editors, this is often phrased as ""verifiability, not truth"" to express the idea that the readers, not the encyclopedia, are ultimately responsible for checking the truthfulness of the articles and making their own interpretations.",English
371,"[93] This can at times lead to the removal of information that, though valid, is not properly sourced.",English
372,"[94] Finally, Wikipedia must not take sides.",English
373,"[95] All opinions and viewpoints, if attributable to external sources, must enjoy an appropriate share of coverage within an article.",English
374,This is known as a neutral point of view (NPOV).,English
375,Wikipedia's initial anarchy integrated democratic and hierarchical elements over time.,English
376,"[96][97] An article is not considered to be owned by its creator or any other editor, nor by the subject of the article.",English
377,"[98] Editors in good standing in the community can run for one of many levels of volunteer stewardship: this begins with ""administrator"",[99][100] privileged users who can delete pages, prevent articles from being changed in case of vandalism or editorial disputes (setting protective measures on articles), and try to prevent certain people from editing.",English
378,"Despite the name, administrators are not supposed to enjoy any special privilege in decision-making; instead, their powers are mostly limited to making edits that have project-wide effects and thus are disallowed to ordinary editors, and to implement restrictions intended to prevent certain persons from making disruptive edits (such as vandalism).",English
379,"[101][102] Fewer editors become administrators than in years past, in part because the process of vetting potential Wikipedia administrators has become more rigorous.",English
380,[103] Bureaucrats name new administrators solely upon the recommendations from the community.,English
381,"Over time, Wikipedia has developed a semi-formal dispute resolution process to assist in such circumstances.",English
382,"To determine community consensus, editors can raise issues at appropriate community forums,[note 5] or seek outside input through third opinion requests or by initiating a more general community discussion known as a ""request for comment"".",English
383,The Arbitration Committee presides over the ultimate dispute resolution process.,English
384,"Although disputes usually arise from a disagreement between two opposing views on how an article should read, the Arbitration Committee explicitly refuses to directly rule on the specific view that should be adopted.",English
385,"Statistical analyses suggest that the committee ignores the content of disputes and rather focuses on the way disputes are conducted,[104] functioning not so much to resolve disputes and make peace between conflicting editors, but to weed out problematic editors while allowing potentially productive editors back in to participate.",English
386,"Therefore, the committee does not dictate the content of articles, although it sometimes condemns content changes when it deems the new content violates Wikipedia policies (for example, if the new content is considered biased).",English
387,"Its remedies include cautions and probations (used in 63% of cases) and banning editors from articles (43%), subject matters (23%), or Wikipedia (16%).",English
388,Complete bans from Wikipedia are generally limited to instances of impersonation and anti-social behavior.,English
389,"When conduct is not impersonation or anti-social, but rather anti-consensus or in violation of editing policies, remedies tend to be limited to warnings.",English
390,"[105] Each article and each user of Wikipedia has an associated ""Talk"" page.",English
391,"These form the primary communication channel for editors to discuss, coordinate and debate.",English
392,"[106] Wikipedia's community has been described as cultlike,[107] although not always with entirely negative connotations.",English
393,"[108] The project's preference for cohesiveness, even if it requires compromise that includes disregard of credentials, has been referred to as ""anti-elitism"".",English
394,[109] Wikipedians sometimes award one another virtual barnstars for good work.,English
395,"These personalized tokens of appreciation reveal a wide range of valued work extending far beyond simple editing to include social support, administrative actions, and types of articulation work.",English
396,[110] Wikipedia does not require that its editors and contributors provide identification.,English
397,"[111] As Wikipedia grew, ""Who writes Wikipedia?""",English
398,became one of the questions frequently asked on the project.,English
399,"[112] Jimmy Wales once argued that only ""a community ... a dedicated group of a few hundred volunteers"" makes the bulk of contributions to Wikipedia and that the project is therefore ""much like any traditional organization"".",English
400,"[113] In 2008, a Slate magazine article reported that: ""According to researchers in Palo Alto, one percent of Wikipedia users are responsible for about half of the site's edits.",English
401,"""[114] This method of evaluating contributions was later disputed by Aaron Swartz, who noted that several articles he sampled had large portions of their content (measured by number of characters) contributed by users with low edit counts.",English
402,"[115] The English Wikipedia has 6,238,672 articles, 40,838,998 registered editors, and 141,020 active editors.",English
403,An editor is considered active if they have made one or more edits in the past 30 days.,English
404,"Editors who fail to comply with Wikipedia cultural rituals, such as signing talk page comments, may implicitly signal that they are Wikipedia outsiders, increasing the odds that Wikipedia insiders may target or discount their contributions.",English
405,"Becoming a Wikipedia insider involves non-trivial costs: the contributor is expected to learn Wikipedia-specific technological codes, submit to a sometimes convoluted dispute resolution process, and learn a ""baffling culture rich with in-jokes and insider references"".",English
406,"[116] Editors who do not log in are in some sense second-class citizens on Wikipedia,[116] as ""participants are accredited by members of the wiki community, who have a vested interest in preserving the quality of the work product, on the basis of their ongoing participation"",[117] but the contribution histories of anonymous unregistered editors recognized only by their IP addresses cannot be attributed to a particular editor with certainty.",English
407,"A 2007 study by researchers from Dartmouth College found that ""anonymous and infrequent contributors to Wikipedia [...] are as reliable a source of knowledge as those contributors who register with the site"".",English
408,"[118] Jimmy Wales stated in 2009 that ""[I]t turns out over 50% of all the edits are done by just .7% of the users ... 524 people ... And in fact, the most active 2%, which is 1400 people, have done 73.4% of all the edits.",English
409,"""[113] However, Business Insider editor and journalist Henry Blodget showed in 2009 that in a random sample of articles, most content in Wikipedia (measured by the amount of contributed text that survives to the latest sampled edit) is created by ""outsiders"", while most editing and formatting is done by ""insiders"".",English
410,"[113] A 2008 study found that Wikipedians were less agreeable, open, and conscientious than others,[119][120] although a later commentary pointed out serious flaws, including that the data showed higher openness and that the differences with the control group and the samples were small.",English
411,"[121] According to a 2009 study, there is ""evidence of growing resistance from the Wikipedia community to new content"".",English
412,[122] Several studies have shown that most of the Wikipedia contributors are male.,English
413,"Notably, the results of a Wikimedia Foundation survey in 2008 showed that only 13 percent of Wikipedia editors were female.",English
414,"[123] Because of this, universities throughout the United States tried to encourage females to become Wikipedia contributors.",English
415,"Similarly, many of these universities, including Yale and Brown, gave college credit to students who create or edit an article relating to women in science or technology.",English
416,"[124] Andrew Lih, a professor and scientist, wrote in The New York Times that the reason he thought the number of male contributors outnumbered the number of females so greatly was because identifying as a woman may expose oneself to ""ugly, intimidating behavior"".",English

418,"[126] There are currently 317 language editions of Wikipedia (also called language versions, or simply Wikipedias).",English

425,"[3] Distribution of the 55,727,399 articles in different language editions (as of January 30, 2021)[130] The unit for the numbers in bars is articles.",English
426,"Since Wikipedia is based on the Web and therefore worldwide, contributors to the same language edition may use different dialects or may come from different countries (as is the case for the English edition).",English
427,These differences may lead to some conflicts over spelling differences (e.g.,English
428,colour versus color)[132] or points of view.,English
429,"[133] Though the various language editions are held to global policies such as ""neutral point of view"", they diverge on some points of policy and practice, most notably on whether images that are not licensed freely may be used under a claim of fair use.",English
430,"[134][135][136] Jimmy Wales has described Wikipedia as ""an effort to create and distribute a free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language"".",English

795,[19]:708–710; 755 Neural networks research had been abandoned by AI and computer science around the same time.,English
796,"This line, too, was continued outside the AI/CS field, as ""connectionism"", by researchers from other disciplines including Hopfield, Rumelhart and Hinton.",English
797,Their main success came in the mid-1980s with the reinvention of backpropagation.,English
798,"[19]:25 Machine learning (ML), reorganized as a separate field, started to flourish in the 1990s.",English
799,The field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature.,English
800,"It shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited from AI, and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics and probability theory.",English
801,"[20] As of 2020, many sources continue to assert that machine learning remains a subfield of AI.",English
802,"[21][22][16] The main disagreement is whether all of ML is part of AI, as this would mean that anyone using ML could claim they are using AI.",English
803,Others have the view that not all of ML is part of AI[23][24][25] where only an 'intelligent' subset of ML is part of AI.,English
804,[26] The question to what is the difference between ML and AI is answered by Judea Pearl in The Book of Why.,English
805,"[27] Accordingly ML learns and predicts based on passive observations, whereas AI implies an agent  interacting with the environment to learn and take actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.",English
806,"[30] Machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly, but while machine learning focuses on prediction, based on known properties learned from the training data, data mining focuses on the discovery of (previously) unknown properties in the data (this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases).",English
807,"Data mining uses many machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs data mining methods as ""unsupervised learning"" or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy.",English
808,"Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals, ECML PKDD being a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge.",English
809,"Evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data.",English
810,Machine learning also has intimate ties to optimization: many learning problems are formulated as minimization of some loss function on a training set of examples.,English
811,"Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances (for example, in classification, one wants to assign a label to instances, and models are trained to correctly predict the pre-assigned labels of a set of examples).",English
812,"[31] The difference between optimization and machine learning arises from the goal of generalization: while optimization algorithms can minimize the loss on a training set, machine learning is concerned with minimizing the loss on unseen samples.",English
813,"Characterizing the generalization of various learning algorithms is an active topic of current research, especially for deep learning algorithms.",English
814,"Machine learning and statistics are closely related fields in terms of methods, but distinct in their principal goal: statistics draws population inferences from a sample, while machine learning finds generalizable predictive patterns.",English
815,"[32] According to Michael I. Jordan, the ideas of machine learning, from methodological principles to theoretical tools, have had a long pre-history in statistics.",English
816,[33] He also suggested the term data science as a placeholder to call the overall field.,English
817,"[33] Leo Breiman distinguished two statistical modeling paradigms: data model and algorithmic model,[34] wherein ""algorithmic model"" means more or less the machine learning algorithms like Random forest.",English
818,"Some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning, leading to a combined field that they call statistical learning.",English
819,[35] A core objective of a learner is to generalize from its experience.,English
820,"[3][36] Generalization in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new, unseen examples/tasks after having experienced a learning data set.",English
821,The training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution (considered representative of the space of occurrences) and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases.,English
822,The computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory.,English
823,"Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms.",English
824,"Instead, probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common.",English
825,The bias–variance decomposition is one way to quantify generalization error.,English
826,"For the best performance in the context of generalization, the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data.",English
827,"If the hypothesis is less complex than the function, then the model has under fitted the data.",English
828,"If the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases.",English
829,"But if the hypothesis is too complex, then the model is subject to overfitting and generalization will be poorer.",English
830,"[37] In addition to performance bounds, learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning.",English
831,"In computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time.",English
832,There are two kinds of time complexity results.,English
833,Positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time.,English
834,Negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time.,English
835,"The types of machine learning algorithms differ in their approach, the type of data they input and output, and the type of task or problem that they are intended to solve.",English
836,Supervised learning algorithms build a mathematical model of a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs.,English
837,"[38] The data is known as training data, and consists of a set of training examples.",English
838,"Each training example has one or more inputs and the desired output, also known as a supervisory signal.",English
839,"In the mathematical model, each training example is represented by an array or vector, sometimes called a feature vector, and the training data is represented by a matrix.",English
840,"Through iterative optimization of an objective function, supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be used to predict the output associated with new inputs.",English
841,[39] An optimal function will allow the algorithm to correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a part of the training data.,English
842,An algorithm that improves the accuracy of its outputs or predictions over time is said to have learned to perform that task.,English
843,"[13] Types of supervised learning algorithms include active learning, classification and regression.",English
844,"[40] Classification algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values, and regression algorithms are used when the outputs may have any numerical value within a range.",English
845,"As an example, for a classification algorithm that filters emails, the input would be an incoming email, and the output would be the name of the folder in which to file the email.",English
846,"Similarity learning is an area of supervised machine learning closely related to regression and classification, but the goal is to learn from examples using a similarity function that measures how similar or related two objects are.",English
847,"It has applications in ranking, recommendation systems, visual identity tracking, face verification, and speaker verification.",English
848,"Unsupervised learning algorithms take a set of data that contains only inputs, and find structure in the data, like grouping or clustering of data points.",English
849,"The algorithms, therefore, learn from test data that has not been labeled, classified or categorized.",English
850,"Instead of responding to feedback, unsupervised learning algorithms identify commonalities in the data and react based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data.",English
851,"A central application of unsupervised learning is in the field of density estimation in statistics, such as finding the probability density function.",English
852,[41] Though unsupervised learning encompasses other domains involving summarizing and explaining data features.,English
853,"Cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets (called clusters) so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to one or more predesignated criteria, while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar.",English
854,"Different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data, often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated, for example, by internal compactness, or the similarity between members of the same cluster, and separation, the difference between clusters.",English
855,Other methods are based on estimated density and graph connectivity.,English
856,Semi-supervised learning falls between unsupervised learning (without any labeled training data) and supervised learning (with completely labeled training data).,English
857,"Some of the training examples are missing training labels,  yet many machine-learning researchers have found that unlabeled data, when used in conjunction with a small amount of labeled data, can produce a considerable improvement in learning accuracy.",English
858,"In weakly supervised learning, the training labels are noisy, limited, or imprecise; however, these labels are often cheaper to obtain, resulting in larger effective training sets.",English
859,[42] Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.,English
860,"Due to its generality, the field is studied in many other disciplines, such as game theory, control theory, operations research, information theory, simulation-based optimization, multi-agent systems, swarm intelligence, statistics and genetic algorithms.",English
861,"In machine learning, the environment is typically represented as a Markov decision process (MDP).",English
862,Many reinforcement learning algorithms use dynamic programming techniques.,English
863,"[43] Reinforcement learning algorithms do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the MDP, and are used when exact models are infeasible.",English
864,Reinforcement learning algorithms are used in autonomous vehicles or in learning to play a game against a human opponent.,English
865,Self-learning as a machine learning paradigm was introduced in 1982 along with a neural network capable of self-learning named crossbar adaptive array (CAA).,English
866,[44] It is a learning with no external rewards and no external teacher advice.,English
867,"The CAA self-learning algorithm computes, in a crossbar fashion, both decisions about actions and emotions (feelings) about consequence situations.",English
868,The system is driven by the interaction between cognition and emotion.,English
869,"[45]
The self-learning algorithm updates a memory matrix W =||w(a,s)|| such that in each iteration executes the following machine learning routine: It is a system with only one input, situation s, and only one output, action (or behavior) a.",English
870,There is neither a separate reinforcement input nor an advice input from the environment.,English
871,The backpropagated value (secondary reinforcement) is the emotion toward the consequence situation.,English
872,"The CAA exists in two environments, one is the behavioral environment where it behaves, and the other is the genetic environment, wherefrom it initially and only once receives initial emotions about situations to be encountered in the behavioral environment.",English
873,"After receiving the genome (species) vector from the genetic environment, the CAA learns a goal-seeking behavior, in an environment that contains both desirable and undesirable situations.",English
874,[46] Several learning algorithms aim at discovering better representations of the inputs provided during training.,English
875,[47] Classic examples include principal components analysis and cluster analysis.,English
876,"Feature learning algorithms, also called representation learning algorithms, often attempt to preserve the information in their input but also transform it in a way that makes it useful, often as a pre-processing step before performing classification or predictions.",English
877,"This technique allows reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown data-generating distribution, while not being necessarily faithful to configurations that are implausible under that distribution.",English
878,"This replaces manual feature engineering, and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task.",English
879,Feature learning can be either supervised or unsupervised.,English
880,"In supervised feature learning, features are learned using labeled input data.",English
881,"Examples include artificial neural networks, multilayer perceptrons, and supervised dictionary learning.",English
882,"In unsupervised feature learning, features are learned with unlabeled input data.",English
883,"Examples include dictionary learning, independent component analysis, autoencoders, matrix factorization[48] and various forms of clustering.",English
884,[49][50][51] Manifold learning algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is low-dimensional.,English
885,"Sparse coding algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse, meaning that the mathematical model has many zeros.",English
886,"Multilinear subspace learning algorithms aim to learn low-dimensional representations directly from tensor representations for multidimensional data, without reshaping them into higher-dimensional vectors.",English
887,"[52] Deep learning algorithms discover multiple levels of representation, or a hierarchy of features, with higher-level, more abstract features defined in terms of (or generating) lower-level features.",English
888,It has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data.,English
889,[53] Feature learning is motivated by the fact that machine learning tasks such as classification often require input that is mathematically and computationally convenient to process.,English
890,"However, real-world data such as images, video, and sensory data has not yielded to attempts to algorithmically define specific features.",English
891,"An alternative is to discover such features or representations thorough examination, without relying on explicit algorithms.",English
892,"Sparse dictionary learning is a feature learning method where a training example is represented as a linear combination of basis functions, and is assumed to be a sparse matrix.",English
893,The method is strongly NP-hard and difficult to solve approximately.,English
894,[54] A popular heuristic method for sparse dictionary learning is the K-SVD algorithm.,English
895,Sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts.,English
896,"In classification, the problem is to determine the class to which a previously unseen training example belongs.",English
897,"For a dictionary where each class has already been built, a new training example is associated with the class that is best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary.",English
898,Sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in image de-noising.,English
899,"The key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary, but the noise cannot.",English
900,"[55] In data mining, anomaly detection, also known as outlier detection, is the identification of rare items, events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data.",English
901,"[56] Typically, the anomalous items represent an issue such as bank fraud, a structural defect, medical problems or errors in a text.",English
902,"Anomalies are referred to as outliers, novelties, noise, deviations and exceptions.",English
903,"[57] In particular, in the context of abuse and network intrusion detection, the interesting objects are often not rare objects, but unexpected bursts of inactivity.",English
904,"This pattern does not adhere to the common statistical definition of an outlier as a rare object, and many outlier detection methods (in particular, unsupervised algorithms) will fail on such data unless it has been aggregated appropriately.",English
905,"Instead, a cluster analysis algorithm may be able to detect the micro-clusters formed by these patterns.",English
906,[58] Three broad categories of anomaly detection techniques exist.,English
907,"[59] Unsupervised anomaly detection techniques detect anomalies in an unlabeled test data set under the assumption that the majority of the instances in the data set are normal, by looking for instances that seem to fit least to the remainder of the data set.",English
908,"Supervised anomaly detection techniques require a data set that has been labeled as ""normal"" and ""abnormal"" and involves training a classifier (the key difference to many other statistical classification problems is the inherently unbalanced nature of outlier detection).",English
909,Semi-supervised anomaly detection techniques construct a model representing normal behavior from a given normal training data set and then test the likelihood of a test instance to be generated by the model.,English
910,"In developmental robotics, robot learning algorithms generate their own sequences of learning experiences, also known as a curriculum, to cumulatively acquire new skills through self-guided exploration and social interaction with humans.",English
911,"These robots use guidance mechanisms such as active learning, maturation, motor synergies and imitation.",English
912,Association rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering relationships between variables in large databases.,English
913,"It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measure of ""interestingness"".",English
914,"[60] Rule-based machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies, learns, or evolves ""rules"" to store, manipulate or apply knowledge.",English
915,The defining characteristic of a rule-based machine learning algorithm is the identification and utilization of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system.,English
916,This is in contrast to other machine learning algorithms that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction.,English
917,"[61] Rule-based machine learning approaches include learning classifier systems, association rule learning, and artificial immune systems.",English
918,"Based on the concept of strong rules, Rakesh Agrawal, Tomasz Imieliński and Arun Swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large-scale transaction data recorded by point-of-sale (POS) systems in supermarkets.",English
919,"[62] For example, the rule

920,Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as promotional pricing or product placements.,English
921,"In addition to market basket analysis, association rules are employed today in application areas including Web usage mining, intrusion detection, continuous production, and bioinformatics.",English
922,"In contrast with sequence mining, association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions.",English
923,"Learning classifier systems (LCS) are a family of rule-based machine learning algorithms that combine a discovery component, typically a genetic algorithm, with a learning component, performing either supervised learning, reinforcement learning, or unsupervised learning.",English
924,They seek to identify a set of context-dependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a piecewise manner in order to make predictions.,English
925,"[63] Inductive logic programming (ILP) is an approach to rule-learning using logic programming as a uniform representation for input examples, background knowledge, and hypotheses.",English
926,"Given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts, an ILP system will derive a hypothesized logic program that entails all positive and no negative examples.",English
927,"Inductive programming is a related field that considers any kind of programming language for representing hypotheses (and not only logic programming), such as functional programs.",English
928,Inductive logic programming is particularly useful in bioinformatics and natural language processing.,English
929,Gordon Plotkin and Ehud Shapiro laid the initial theoretical foundation for inductive machine learning in a logical setting.,English
930,[64][65][66] Shapiro built their first implementation (Model Inference System) in 1981: a Prolog program that inductively inferred logic programs from positive and negative examples.,English
931,"[67] The term inductive here refers to philosophical induction, suggesting a theory to explain observed facts, rather than mathematical induction, proving a property for all members of a well-ordered set.",English
932,"Performing machine learning involves creating a model, which is trained on some training data and then can process additional data to make predictions.",English
933,Various types of models have been used and researched for machine learning systems.,English
934,"Artificial neural networks (ANNs), or connectionist systems, are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains.",English
935,"Such systems ""learn"" to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with any task-specific rules.",English
936,"An ANN is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called ""artificial neurons"", which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain.",English
937,"Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit information, a ""signal"", from one artificial neuron to another.",English
938,An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it.,English
939,"In common ANN implementations, the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a real number, and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs.",English
940,"The connections between artificial neurons are called ""edges"".",English
941,Artificial neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds.,English
942,The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection.,English
943,Artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold.,English
944,"Typically, artificial neurons are aggregated into layers.",English
945,Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs.,English
946,"Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer) to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.",English
947,The original goal of the ANN approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would.,English
948,"However, over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to deviations from biology.",English
949,"Artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, social network filtering, playing board and video games and medical diagnosis.",English
950,Deep learning consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network.,English
951,This approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing.,English
952,Some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition.,English
953,[68] Decision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model to go from observations about an item (represented in the branches) to conclusions about the item's target value (represented in the leaves).,English
954,"It is one of the predictive modeling approaches used in statistics, data mining, and machine learning.",English
955,"Tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees; in these tree structures, leaves represent class labels and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels.",English
956,Decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values (typically real numbers) are called regression trees.,English
957,"In decision analysis, a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making.",English
958,"In data mining, a decision tree describes data, but the resulting classification tree can be an input for decision making.",English
959,"Support vector machines (SVMs), also known as support vector networks, are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression.",English
960,"Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category or the other.",English
961,"[69]  An SVM training algorithm is a non-probabilistic, binary, linear classifier, although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting.",English
962,"In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.",English
963,Regression analysis encompasses a large variety of statistical methods to estimate the relationship between input variables and their associated features.,English
964,"Its most common form is linear regression, where a single line is drawn to best fit the given data according to a mathematical criterion such as ordinary least squares.",English
965,"The latter is often extended by regularization (mathematics) methods to mitigate overfitting and bias, as in ridge regression.",English
966,"When dealing with non-linear problems, go-to models include polynomial regression (for example, used for trendline fitting in Microsoft Excel[70]), logistic regression (often used in statistical classification) or even kernel regression, which introduces non-linearity by taking advantage of the kernel trick to implicitly map input variables to higher-dimensional space.",English
967,"A Bayesian network, belief network, or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independence with a directed acyclic graph (DAG).",English
968,"For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms.",English
969,"Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases.",English
970,Efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning.,English
971,"Bayesian networks that model sequences of variables, like speech signals or protein sequences, are called dynamic Bayesian networks.",English
972,Generalizations of Bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called influence diagrams.,English
973,"A genetic algorithm (GA) is a search algorithm and heuristic technique that mimics the process of natural selection, using methods such as mutation and crossover to generate new genotypes in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem.",English
974,"In machine learning, genetic algorithms were used in the 1980s and 1990s.",English
975,"[71][72] Conversely, machine learning techniques have been used to improve the performance of genetic and evolutionary algorithms.",English
976,"[73] Usually, machine learning models require a lot of data in order for them to perform well.",English
977,"Usually, when training a machine learning model, one needs to collect a large, representative sample of data from a training set.",English
978,"Data from the training set can be as varied as a corpus of text, a collection of images, and data collected from individual users of a service.",English
979,Overfitting is something to watch out for when training a machine learning model.,English
980,Trained models derived from biased data can result in skewed or undesired predictions.,English
981,Algorithmic bias is a potential result from data not fully prepared for training.,English
982,"Federated learning is an adapted form of distributed artificial intelligence to training machine learning models that decentralizes the training process, allowing for users' privacy to be maintained by not needing to send their data to a centralized server.",English
983,This also increases efficiency by decentralizing the training process to many devices.,English
984,"For example, Gboard uses federated machine learning to train search query prediction models on users' mobile phones without having to send individual searches back to Google.",English
985,"[74] There are many applications for machine learning, including: In 2006, the media-services provider Netflix held the first ""Netflix Prize"" competition to find a program to better predict user preferences and improve the accuracy of its existing Cinematch movie recommendation algorithm by at least 10%.",English
986,A joint team made up of researchers from AT&T Labs-Research in collaboration with the teams Big Chaos and Pragmatic Theory built an ensemble model to win the Grand Prize in 2009 for $1 million.,English
987,"[76] Shortly after the prize was awarded, Netflix realized that viewers' ratings were not the best indicators of their viewing patterns (""everything is a recommendation"") and they changed their recommendation engine accordingly.",English

991,[80] In 2019 Springer Nature published the first research book created using machine learning.,English
992,"[81] Although machine learning has been transformative in some fields, machine-learning programs often fail to deliver expected results.",English
993,"[82][83][84] Reasons for this are numerous: lack of (suitable) data, lack of access to the data, data bias, privacy problems, badly chosen tasks and algorithms, wrong tools and people, lack of resources, and evaluation problems.",English
994,"[85] In 2018, a self-driving car from Uber failed to detect a pedestrian, who was killed after a collision.",English
995,[86] Attempts to use machine learning in healthcare with the IBM Watson system failed to deliver even after years of time and billions of dollars invested.,English
996,[87][88] Machine learning has been used as a strategy to update the evidence related to systematic review and increased reviewer burden related to the growth of biomedical literature.,English
997,"While it has improved with training sets, it has not yet developed sufficiently to reduce the workload burden without limiting the necessary sensitivity for the findings research themselves.",English
998,[89] Machine learning approaches in particular can suffer from different data biases.,English
999,A machine learning system trained on current customers only may not be able to predict the needs of new customer groups that are not represented in the training data.,English
1000,"When trained on man-made data, machine learning is likely to pick up the same constitutional and unconscious biases already present in society.",English
1001,[90] Language models learned from data have been shown to contain human-like biases.,English
1002,[91][92] Machine learning systems used for criminal risk assessment have been found to be biased against black people.,English
1003,"[93][94] In 2015, Google photos would often tag black people as gorillas,[95] and in 2018 this still was not well resolved, but Google reportedly was still using the workaround to remove all gorillas from the training data, and thus was not able to recognize real gorillas at all.",English
1004,[96] Similar issues with recognizing non-white people have been found in many other systems.,English
1005,"[97] In 2016, Microsoft tested a chatbot that learned from Twitter, and it quickly picked up racist and sexist language.",English

1007,"[99] Concern for fairness in machine learning, that is, reducing bias in machine learning and propelling its use for human good is increasingly expressed by artificial intelligence scientists, including Fei-Fei Li, who reminds engineers that ""There’s nothing artificial about AI...It’s inspired by people, it’s created by people, and—most importantly—it impacts people.",English
1008,"It is a powerful tool we are only just beginning to understand, and that is a profound responsibility.”[100] Classification of machine learning models can be validated by accuracy estimation techniques like the holdout method, which splits the data in a training and test set (conventionally 2/3 training set and 1/3 test set designation) and evaluates the performance of the training model on the test set.",English
1009,"In comparison, the K-fold-cross-validation method randomly partitions the data into K subsets and then K experiments are performed each respectively considering 1 subset for evaluation and the remaining K-1 subsets for training the model.",English
1010,"In addition to the holdout and cross-validation methods, bootstrap, which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset, can be used to assess model accuracy.",English
1011,"[101] In addition to overall accuracy, investigators frequently report sensitivity and specificity meaning True Positive Rate (TPR) and True Negative Rate (TNR) respectively.",English
1012,"Similarly, investigators sometimes report the false positive rate (FPR) as well as the false negative rate (FNR).",English
1013,"However, these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators.",English
1014,The total operating characteristic (TOC) is an effective method to express a model's diagnostic ability.,English
1015,"TOC shows the numerators and denominators of the previously mentioned rates, thus TOC provides more information than the commonly used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and ROC's associated area under the curve (AUC).",English
1016,[102] Machine learning poses a host of ethical questions.,English
1017,"Systems which are trained on datasets collected with biases may exhibit these biases upon use (algorithmic bias), thus digitizing cultural prejudices.",English
1018,"[103] For example, using job hiring data from a firm with racist hiring policies may lead to a machine learning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicants against similarity to previous successful applicants.",English
1019,[104][105] Responsible collection of data and documentation of algorithmic rules used by a system thus is a critical part of machine learning.,English
1020,The evolvement of AI systems raises a lot questions in the realm of ethics and morality.,English
1021,"AI can be well equipped in making decisions in certain fields such technical and scientific which rely
heavily on data and historical information.",English
1022,These decisions rely on objectivity and logical reasoning.,English
1023,"[106] Because human languages contain biases, machines trained on language corpora will necessarily also learn these biases.",English
1024,"[107][108] Other forms of ethical challenges, not related to personal biases, are more seen in health care.",English
1025,There are concerns among health care professionals that these systems might not be designed in the public's interest but as income-generating machines.,English
1026,"This is especially true in the United States where there is a long-standing ethical dilemma of improving health care, but also increasing profits.",English
1027,"For example, the algorithms could be designed to provide patients with unnecessary tests or medication in which the algorithm's proprietary owners hold stakes.",English
1028,"There is huge potential for machine learning in health care to provide professionals a great tool to diagnose, medicate, and even plan recovery paths for patients, but this will not happen until the personal biases mentioned previously, and these ""greed"" biases are addressed.",English
1029,"[109] Since the 2010s, advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks (a particular narrow subdomain of machine learning) that contain many layers of non-linear hidden units.",English
1030,"[110] By 2019, graphic processing units (GPUs), often with AI-specific enhancements, had displaced CPUs as the dominant method of training large-scale commercial cloud AI.",English
1031,"[111] OpenAI estimated the hardware compute used in the largest deep learning projects from AlexNet (2012) to AlphaZero (2017), and found a 300,000-fold increase in the amount of compute required, with a doubling-time trendline of 3.4 months.",English
